Because of that, I began to learn another more powerful software called Autodesk Inventor, which is a professional 3D CAD designing software.  Last summer I was offered an opportunity by Kiditech (a non-profit organization) to teach a 3D designing summer camp as a volunteer. This inspired me to start teaching a class of my own, to kids in my neighborhood. I’ve been teaching for a few months now. 3D design helps to develop strong spatial orientation and thinking.  I’m also very interested in Rubik’s Cubes. Currently, I am an officer at the Miller Rubik’s Cube Club and a founder of Lynbrook Cubing at my school.','Alex Lee, Ethan Chen','../../../images/team/alexlee.jpg, ../../../images/team/ethan.jpg','Hello! My name is Alex Lee, and I am a seventh grader at Miller Middle School. I will be your T.A. For the Fall 2018 class. I have been introduced to 3D design for almost a year and I think it is really cool to be able to design something and be able to print it out and actually have it as a model. Outside of 3D design I enjoy playing volleyball, basketball, and tennis. I\'m looking forward to meet you in the class. ------- I am an incoming 7th grader at Joaquin Miller Middle School. I have taken a few SVY classes before, one of them being a Tinkercad class. I got really interested in 3D design, so I also took a different class for Fusion 360. I usually get the hang of the classwork pretty fast and I always help other classmates when I’m done with my work. I have taken many other classes that have to do with computer softwares so I know lots of the material. I’m really interested in 3D design, game design, and programming, and I’m pretty good at it. I think as a teacher I can help out in the class and help people learn what I learned before.','STEM'))
