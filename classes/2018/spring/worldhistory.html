                    <p>This course will be mainly focused on four major events of world history: the French Revolution, World War I, World War II and the Cold War. Each of the topics will expand 2 classes.  In the class we will discuss how the events started, what happened during each event, and how those events impacted the world then and now. Particularly, we will focus on the important and interesting events that happened during these conflicts. </p>

                        <p style="padding: 15px 0">My name is Stefan Meier, and I am a freshman at Saratoga High School. I really enjoy learning about history and I want to share what I know to my fellow students. I became fascinated with history at very early age when my grandpa told me stories about his life.
                        Learning history helps us to understand the world we live in today. It is also important because through studying history, we learn the mistakes of our ancestors so we do not do the same things they did. I will make the class entertaining by mixing different teaching methods: powerpoint, video clips, games and quizzes. 

                        My favorite subjects are history, science, and math. I earned an AMC8 top score. I have also participated in several public forum debate tournaments the past year. I play competitive tennis and I am part of the school tennis team. In addition, I enjoy playing the guitar, and I’m on the school jazz band.

                        <p style="padding: 15px 0"> I have an extensive learning experience in history and science. Back in third grade, I have read a simplified version of the Chinese History, which consisted of times and events from the beginning of the Xia Dynasty to the end of the Qing Dynasty. I read extensively in contemporary World History and understand many of the major events in the 1900s and their impact on humanity. To improve my knowledge in both Chinese, US and world history, I talk with my parents and teachers, whom give me better understanding on the Cold War and Chinese History.</p> <p>I volunteered in many club fundraisers and events, especially in my school’s debate club, where I participated in hosting and running scrimmages and meetings. I also participated in many church holiday events, science events and local sports events in my local community.</p>
