                    <p>In this class, students learn to push to their limits to achieve success in the vast world of conditioning and basketball. Each practice will consist of multiple drills, a conditioning/workout, and a fun activity in the end. These drills and workouts target certain aspects of the game, including dribbling, shooting form, defense, rebounding, and overall sense of the game. Players may use tennis balls, cones, and ladders for more advanced drills, while the fun activity at the end can be a competition or a scrimmage with varied rules. We focus on improving each and every student’s skills while having fun.
