                    Our class is targeted for any middle school students that take interest in learning more about the art of research and persuasion. Our course aims to teach students techniques on presenting arguments, asking the right questions, finding qualified evidence, and good delivery. Regardless of whether you would like to pursue debate in the future, public speaking and building a case around a position is integral to anything you would like to do. In the span of three months, this course will hold three to four formal debates in a variety of styles that are offered in high school debate.

                        <p style="padding: 15px 0">Claire Cheng is a current sophomore at Gunn High School. She is an avid member of her school’s debate team, focusing primarily on Policy. This will be Claire’s third year involved with debating. In her first year of high school, Claire and her partner were incredibly grateful in qualifying for Nationals in Policy debate. Claire loves debating as it has helped her recognize the validity of opposing arguments and the controversy behind every government policy. Debate as taught her to become slower to judge and form opinions. The world is far from black and white, instead, it is many muddy shades of gray. Debating and public speaking are useful tools vital to daily conversations. In her free time, Claire loves to write about social issues, volunteer at her local Chinese school, and journal.
