                    <p>Public speaking is a skill that people need to be successful in your career and social life. Students will study the details of social interactions and the psychology of public speaking. Students will also read current events and learn how to analyze the text quickly. Afterward, the students will give presentations every class and receive positive feedback from not only their teachers, but their classmates as well. By the end of the semester, students should be able to speak confidently, adapt to high-pressure situations, improve their critical reading skills, and be well informed of current events.

                        <p>My name is Neil, and I am very excited to be the Teching Assistant for the Public Speaking and Current Events class at Silicon Valley Youth. I lived mainly in San Diego for the first years of my life, and started piano around three, as well as occasional tennis classes. I moved to the Bay Area about a year later, continued with my piano, and attended Stevens Creek Elementary. A few months after I moved, I began a new sport: judo. I also began swimming classes at the YMCA, then transferred to Saratoga Star Aquatics two years later. Additionally, I also took fencing classes. After I entered Kennedy Middle School, I took two Silicon Valley Youth courses: Website Design and Current Events and Public Speaking. Currently I am also attending the Speech and Debate clubs at my school.
