                    Introduction to Java is a fast-paced, 10 lesson long programming course that centers around teaching students about the workings of Java, how to program it, and what computer programming is all about. Java is a giant language in the technology industry, used by many companies for services, and even in games, such as Minecraft. Coding is an essential skill in the twenty-first century, and gives learners the ability to excel in the modern competition for jobs. Students will move through critically important topics of Java such as variables, iteration, and objects. This class aims to introduce coding to students in a fun and engaging way, including hands-on activities, teacher-led type-alongs, homework, as well as a fun project. Students will learn different strategies in coding, how to work in the professional workplace environment, and how to work independently on code.

I am in my sophomore year at Monta Vista High School. I have passion for business,  games and computer programming in general. The reason why I first got into computer programming was because I was interested in games and was inspired by them to try to create my own game. As a programmer and as a teacher, I was to also inspire my friends and younger generations to take up the interest of computer programming. Computer is not only a door to creativity and better thinking, but it also become essential to getting good jobs and favorable careers in the modern age. At Silicon Valley Youth, out priority is to bring creativity and new ideas to the classroom, and I hope to that throughout this semester of class! Good luck, and I hope to have a great class with everyone!

I can contribute to this class through my teaching experience and my knowledge of the basics in Java. By taking part in my school’s academic center program, I have practical experience in teaching. I am also currently taking a java course outside and inside of school, so although my time spent on Java seems small, I do have the required amount of knowledge to be able to teach this class. I want to be part of the organization as I feel it provides perhaps a better learning environment than actual classes in school, due to students being more open to other students.
