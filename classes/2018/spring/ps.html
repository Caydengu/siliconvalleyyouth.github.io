      <p>Current events are news that are currently happening around the world. Every other week, students will choose recent news topics to focus on. They will be researching these topics and giving a five minute presentation for a topic during class. The instructor and TA will help with discussions and give the presenter feedback, as well as helping students effectively analyze text and be able to speak well. By the end of the course, students will be able to speak and lead confidently in front of an audience, develop critical thinking skills, and be more informed on current events.

                        <p style="padding: 15px 0">Tony Taimin Liao is an eighth grader at Jordan middle school.  He has lived in Palo Alto for two years.  Before moving to Palo Alto, he lived in Zhuhai, China, where he developed an early interest in international relations and social justice.  Having a background in the cultures of both nations, he satisfied his curious mind with Literature, History, and Policy Debate. Due to these reasons, he has gained much knowledge regarding the human condition, and he tries to use what he has learned to improve personal moral rectitude, thereby becoming a man of principles.  When he is in school, Tony Taimin Liao has a diverse interest in different activities. Currently,  he is the leader of the school Asian Traditional Culture Club and the first chair cellist for advanced Orchestra and Chamber Ensemble in school.  Through these various experiences, he elevates his leadership ability and professional skill in order to pursue his lifelong plan.  Outside of school, he is the founder of the HYTF international cultural communication, a non-profit organization that specifically focuses on cultural development and the history behind every nation.  Writing creative pieces also occupies his time.  He thoroughly enjoys experiencing the creative process. Writing attracts him like a little boy who is attracted to a show. And his desire for writing is not only limited to the language, but he has also developed a sophisticated interest in politics and economy.</p>
