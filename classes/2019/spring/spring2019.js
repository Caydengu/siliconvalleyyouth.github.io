Yes, but understanding “life” is way more than memorizing vocabularies and concepts; in fact, it’s astounding how much biological studies matters to the real world! Together, we will explore life from macromolecules to the organisms formed by them, from genetics to natural selection, and how individuals interact with their ecological surroundings. This class is designed for students interested in life science to discover and acquire knowledge through analyzing past biological experiments, in-class research, and active discussions with your peers. At each session, students will be introduced to one topic on Biology and general concepts through lectures and hands-on experiments; we will look at specific studies while understanding the principles behind natural phenomena: What controls heredity? What’s the factor of allergy? Students will share and explain their thoughts after individual research. Don’t worry if you think research and experiments are not your thing yet - The concepts are just as simple as they perform trillions of time in the real world, and you will learn with your peers. Let’s go beyond the textbook and become future pioneer scientists! This class touches upon all levels of general biology mainly based on first-year biology, and we will make a gradually transition to AP Biology depending on the students’ understanding.
