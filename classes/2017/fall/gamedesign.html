                    <p>Game Design is a 10-lesson class that allows students to explore the art of making games with Java. Students will be taught the basics to how to manipulate windows, images, and animations in their games. The goal of this class is for each person to complete a single simple game, such as tic-tac-toe, in their program. Students may need to work on the project between lessons depending on the difficulty of their game and their game development skills. This class focuses to enhance coding skills as well as creativity and other essential skills in the modern workplace.</p>

I am in my sophomore year at Monta Vista High School. I have passion for business, games and computer programming in general. The reason why I first got into computer programming was because I was interested in games and was inspired by them to try to create my own game. As a programmer and as a teacher, I was to also inspire my friends and younger generations to take up the interest of computer programming. Computer is not only a door to creativity and better thinking, but it also become essential to getting good jobs and favorable careers in the modern age. At Silicon Valley Youth, out priority is to bring creativity and new ideas to the classroom, and I hope to that throughout this semester of class! Good luck, and I hope to have a great class with everyone!</p>
