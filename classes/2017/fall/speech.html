                    <p> This course will teach students about high school competitive speech, primarily focusing on the national non-spontaneous events (excluding informative speaking). Students will learn about each event and draft speeches for both the oratorical and interpretive categories. At the end of the course, they will present one of the two speeches at a showcase. Students will focus both on speech writing and cutting and presentational/delivery skills. Note: please bring a laptop and be ready to take notes during class. We will try to go green and be a paperless classroom.</p>

This will be Claire’s third year involved with debating. In her first year of high school debate, Claire and her partner have gone undefeated at League three and secured a spot for State Qualifications. This past summer, Claire and her partner (a double freshman team) were incredibly grateful in qualifying for the National Speech and Debate Association tournament in Alabama. Claire has fallen in love with the art of conveying ideas through speeches. She finds it a useful tool vital to daily conversations. In her free time, Claire loves to write about social issues, volunteer at her local Chinese school, and journal. She is looking forward to a class this season!</p>
