                        <p>Henry loves the science bowl class. He got greatly inspired by the two teachers and always wanted to go to the classes even after exhausted physical training right before the Science Bowl sessions. We as parents are impressed by the knowledge of the teachers and their genuine passion in teaching the students to explore and excel. Thank you so much Oliver and Tim! Great job!</p>

                        <p>This class is an eye opener for my science loving daughter! It expands her horizons of the variety and the depth of the science subjects, while had fun with buzzers and bonus questions. She also appreciated Oliver and Tim tried to maintain the class order when students got so excited. Hope these classes had given her good seeds for her future growth of passion and knowledge of Science.</p>

                        <p>The first Science Bowl experience with Oliver and Tim for my son Minh was great! Both teachers are not only knowledgeable but also have great desire to share it with their students. They were able to bring the class back to focus before some young students getting too excited. Best of all, this class makes Science a "COOL" subject. Thank you, Oliver &amp; Tim! Also appreciated all the parents' great effort!</p>

                        <p>The Science Bowl class is well prepared by Oliver and Tim. There are a lot of interactions during the classes. Kids are motivated to participate and ask questions. It is a very good class for kids to learn the science bowl competition and related science knowledge. My son Wayne always looks forward to it even after long swimming meets during the day. As parents, we appreciate Oliver and Tim's efforts and time. Also thanks to Oliver and Tim's Moms!</p>
