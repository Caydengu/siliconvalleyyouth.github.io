                                in Haimen, China. It is a free class which
                                lasted three weeks, every day. Bryan taught
                                critical reading. Benjamin taught
                                grammar. Students in Haimen never had a chance
                                to listen to authentic spoken English, rarely
                                had the opportunity to speak English
